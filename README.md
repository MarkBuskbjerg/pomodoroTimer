# pomodoroTimer

This is just a simple exercise project. Don't expect much :)

I started with this project idea from Chris Ferdinandi as inspiration: https://gist.github.com/cferdinandi/795c87138f65911aefa44eb1e21bd8bf

I wanted to experiment with pausing and resetting the timer, so I did a classic pomodorotimer. Counting down from 25 minutes with the ability to either pause the clock or resetting for a new pomodoro.
